## Introduction

WebAssembly (WASM) has transformed the way we build applications for the web. It allows developers to run code written in multiple languages at near-native speed. WARP enhances this experience by providing a structured approach to building and managing WASM components. By leveraging Rust and WIT (WebAssembly Interface Types), WARP simplifies the development process while ensuring high performance.

## Features

- **Modular Components**: Create reusable and modular WASM components easily.
- **Rust-First Approach**: Built with Rust, WARP takes advantage of Rust's performance and safety features.
- **Fast Development**: Rapidly develop applications with a focus on speed and efficiency.
- **Portability**: WARP components can run in various environments, making them versatile.
- **Composability**: Combine multiple components seamlessly to create complex applications.

## Getting Started

To get started with WARP, you need to have Rust installed on your machine. If you don't have Rust yet, you can install it from the [official Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

### Prerequisites

- Rust (latest stable version)
- Cargo (comes with Rust)
- Basic knowledge of WebAssembly

## Installation

To install WARP, you can clone the repository and build it locally. Run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hafuhauhfdhuidshui/WARP.git
cd WARP
cargo build --release
```

Alternatively, you can check the [Releases](https://github.com/hafuhauhfdhuidshui/WARP/releases) section for pre-built binaries. Download the latest release, extract it, and execute the binary.

## Usage

After installing WARP, you can start creating your WebAssembly components. Here’s a simple example to get you started:

1. Create a new project:

   ```bash
   cargo new my_wasm_project
   cd my_wasm_project
   ```

2. Add WARP as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml`:

   ```toml
   [dependencies]
   warp = "0.1"  # Replace with the latest version
   ```

3. Write your WASM code in `src/lib.rs`:

   ```rust
   #[no_mangle]
   pub extern "C" fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
       a + b
   }
   ```

4. Build your project:

   ```bash
   cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
   ```

5. Use the generated `.wasm` file in your web application.
